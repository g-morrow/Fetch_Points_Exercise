1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
    - I used the CSV module to be able to quickly parse through the CSV file and input it into a local data structure.
    - I chose python because it is a very readable language and would therefore be easy for the grader to understand.
        I also am very comfortable in python and knew the dictionary data structure was very well suited for the
        project requirements because it is a clean and legible way to group data. 

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
    - Advantages
        - Time complexity is O(n).
        - Accounts for scenarios where mistakes could have been made with exceptions.
        - Work is split into functions making it easy to make adjustments to implementation. 
    - Disadvantages
        - Data is not sorted as it is placed in the dictionary.
        - Code relies on CSV files being properly formatted.
        - Only reads CSV instead of other types of separated files (ex. TSV)

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
    - A favorite project I have worked on was recreating deleted images and filenames from a disk image.
        This project was done in C and required a strong understanding of file systems and memory allocation.
        I found this project challenging as it involved parsing through disk images manually by reading inode
        tables and working with anywhere from single to triple indirect pointers. Although this project was
        challenging, I learned a lot and was able to practice debugging skills, working in an unfamiliar environment,
        and applying learning in a hands-on environment.
