To run points.py run the following line in the terminal:
    python3 points.py (amount of points to spend) (csv filename)

Example: spending 5000 points, csv filename is transactions.csv
    python3 points.py 5000 transactions.csv

Troubleshooting:
    - If python is not installed on your device you can download it at https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - Make sure you have entered the full filename, including .csv and points to spend does not include commas.
    - Check that the file is in the same folder as the points.py file.
